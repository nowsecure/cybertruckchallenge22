A new mobile remote keyless system "CyberTruck" has been implemented by one of the most well-known car security companies "NowSecure Mobile Vehicles". The car security company has ensured that the system is entirely uncrackable and therefore attackers will not be able to recover secrets within the mobile application.

If you are an experienced Android reverser, then enable the "tamperproof" button to harden the application before unlocking your cars. Your goal will consist on recovering up to 6 secrets in the application.



>> Challenge1 to unlock car1
Title: "DES key: Completely Keyless. Completely safe."

There is a secret used to create a DES key. Can you tell me which one?
	50  - static  = s3cr3t$_n3veR_mUst_bE_h4rdc0d3d_m4t3!

There is a token generated at runtime to unlock the carid=1. Can you get it? (flag must be summitted in hexa all lowercase)
	100 - dynamic = 046e04ff67535d25dfea022033fcaaf23606b95a5c07a8c6


>> Challenge2 to unlock car2
Title: "AES key: Your Cell Mobile Is Your Key"

This challenge has been obfuscated with ProGuard, therefore you will not recover the AES key.
	50 - static   = d474_47_r357_mu57_pR073C73D700!!

There is a token generated at runtime to unlock the carid=2. Can you get it? (flag must be summitted in hexa all lowercase)
	100 - dynamic = 512100f7cc50c76906d23181aff63f0d642b3d947f75d360b6b15447540e4f16


>> Challenge3 to unlock
Title: "Mr Truck: Unlock me Baby!"

There is an interesting string in the native code. Can you catch it?
	50 -  static  = Native_c0d3_1s_h4rd3r_To_r3vers3

Get the secret generated at runtime to unlock the carid=3. Security by obscurity is not a great design. Use real crypto! (hint: check the length when summitting the secret!)
	200 - dynamic = backd00r$Mu$tAlw4ysBeF0rb1dd3n$$
